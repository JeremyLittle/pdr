## Pop Quiz!

I have started on [Lab 6](../../../../labs/lab06/index.html) (hashes), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.

## Midterm 1 topic coverage
- All slide sets through [numbers](../slides/03-numbers.html#/)

- For the [arrays & bigoh](../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/) slide set:
  - The [arrays section](../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/arrays) is fair game
  - The [orders of growth section](../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/growth) will be covered at a very light level (meaning: you should be able to state the run-time of various algorithms we studied -- which has already been covered -- but we won't ask you to do big-Oh proofs)
  - The [determining running times section](../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/arrays) is a reinforcement and review of determining the running times of things, so that's fair game as well
- All the material covered in the labs and tutorials
- Note that we often purposefully put in new content (a new data strucure, etc.) that you have never seen to see how you adapt what you have learned to that...
- See the [old exams](../exams/index.html) in the repo!
  - Note that we do not post solutions to the old exams
  - And the TAs will not answer 'what is the answer to this' postings on Piazza
  - But you can always come to office hours!

## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- There is typically a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate the second (of five!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

## Lecture 13: Wednesday, February 17th
- Office hours are in full swing; see the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ) for details
- [Lab 4](../labs/lab04/index.html) (numbers) and the [tutorial](../tutorials/03-04-more-unix/index.html) (Unix, part 2) is out
  - You can get your floating point number at http://libra.cs.virginia.edu/getfloat.php
- We'll talk about the snow day implications next...
- Next week is the first midterm.  Yay!
- Grades through [lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html) have been returned; you can view them in the [course gradebook](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/gradebook.php)
  - ... and then we realized that there was a screw-up on in-lab 2 and post-lab 2, so more on that in a few days (they are all going to be regraded)...
  - Grading guidelines are on the Collab wiki (*not* in the repository!)
  - [Regrades](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php) must be submitted within 10 days
- Remember that you ***MUST*** do the in-labs from a lab computer!  You can't use your own personal laptops in that room.
- Lecture recordings are posted online in a Flash movie format; see the [uva/index.html](index.html) file for the links
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/c9a32516-382f-449d-86b1-f738d75a2015/)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [numbers](../slides/03-numbers.html#/), aiming to start [arrays & big-Oh](../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/) today as well
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Our second snow day...
- Everybody got a 2 day (48 hour) extension on pre-lab 4, so it is now due on Thursday at 9 a.m.
  - This allows us to finish presenting floating point number conversion today, which is needed for the pre-lab
  - This also allows one to attend the Wednesday evening office hours if you need extra help
- No extensions on the in-lab 4 or post-lab 4, since they are independent of the pre-lab
- We are going to try to *not* have a pre-recorded lecture for you to watch
  - We think that we can get through the material "in time"
  - Here, "in time" means before you have to implement it in a lab...
- We'll keep you updated over the next week or so as we see how the schedule plays out...

## Critically important anonymous feedback
Dear Professor Floryan, I, and a few peers had some questions about your immaculately kept scalp. 1) Do you shine your head? 2) If yes, how long does it take you to shine your head? 3) What do you use to shine your head? 4) Have you ever tried turtle wax? 5) What do you use to shave your head? If, for some reason, we've been lied to and this is in fact not anonymous, please know that only one of these questions is mine. Cheers, A student who rather enjoys your class PS. Please answer these hard-hitting questions in class.

## Lecture 3: Monday, January 25th
- Office hours will start today at 6 p.m., and are listed on the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ)

- Registration issues for this semester
  - All *declared* computing majors were notified last night that they will get into the course
  - That leaves 42 people who want into the remaining 2 spots...
  - If you register late, you likely won't have an account for tomorrow's lab; don't stress about this, as we will provide extensions as necessary
- Lab information on the next slide...
- Last Wednesday's lecture is posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From the [uva/index.html](index.html) file in the repo, click on the right-most link in the main table

  - The assignment submission automatically opened Sunday at noon
  - To get started, you can view the repo online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/ (the lab is [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/labs/lab01/index.html); the tutorial is [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/index.html))
  - Everybody will get a 1 day extension for the pre-lab (so it will be due Wed @ 9 a.m.), and 2 days for the in-lab (so it will be due by the end of the day on Thu); the post-lab will be due as normal
  - Due to the snow day, we may not get through enough material for you to complete the in-lab tomorrow...
- Remember that you ***MUST*** do the in-labs from a lab computer!  You can't use your own personal laptops in that room.
- Your lab accounts and passwords will be e-mailed to you sometime today
  - Bring your Linux password with you to lab on Tuesday!
  - You need to email [root@cs.virginia.edu](mailto:root@cs.virginia.edu) to reset it; we cannot do so ourselves
